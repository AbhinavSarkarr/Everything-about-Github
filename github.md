# Git and GitHub Guide

## Adding a Remote GitHub Repository to a Git Folder

### Command:
```bash
git remote add origin <GitHub_repo_URL>
```
- **remote**: Refers to a repository hosted remotely (e.g., on GitHub).
- **add**: Adds the specified repository to your Git folder.
- **origin**: Acts as the default name mapped to the GitHub repository URL.

---

## Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository

### Command:
```bash
git push origin master
```
- **push**: Sends your changes to the remote repository.
- **origin**: Refers to the URL where changes will be pushed (i.e., the remote repository).
- **master**: Specifies the branch where the changes will be pushed.

Before pushing, ensure your Git folder is initialized and linked to the remote repository.

---

## Working with Branches

1. **Creating a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch <branch_name>
   ```
   - Creates a new branch with the specified name.

2. **Switching to a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```
   - Moves the pointer (HEAD) to the specified branch, making it the active branch.

   > **HEAD** is a pointer that indicates the branch where new commits will be added. When switching branches, HEAD points to the selected branch.

3. **Merging Branches:**
   ```bash
   git merge <branch_name>
   ```
   - Combines changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

## Forking a Repository

Forking creates a copy of another user's repository in your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

### Steps:
1. Fork the repository from the original owner's GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your_forked_repo_URL>
   ```
3. Link the original repository as "upstream":
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream <original_repo_URL>
   ```
4. Verify remote URLs:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

### Important:
- **origin**: Refers to your forked repository.
- **upstream**: Refers to the original repository you forked from.

---

## Pull Requests (PRs)

A pull request (PR) allows you to propose changes to the original repository you forked from. Here's how to create a PR:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Create a duplicate of the original repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your_forked_repo_URL>
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch <branch_name>
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

4. **Make Changes and Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe the changes"
   ```

5. **Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

6. **Raise a Pull Request:**
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Open the branch you worked on.
   - Click **New Pull Request** to propose changes to the original repository.

### Why Create a New Branch After Forking?

When working on multiple features, creating separate branches helps in raising clean, isolated PRs for each feature. For instance:

1. **Scenario:**
   - You fork a repository.
   - Work on a "chat" feature in a branch named `chat`.
   - Push the changes and create a PR named "Chat Feature."

2. **Issue with Reusing the Same Branch:**
   - You begin work on a "voice assistant" feature in the same `chat` branch.
   - When you push changes, they will appear in the existing PR instead of creating a new one.

   This makes reviewing difficult and can lead to confusion. To avoid this, always create a new branch for each feature.

### Key Rule:
- **1 Branch = 1 Pull Request**

---

## Removing a Commit from a Pull Request

If you accidentally include an unwanted commit in a PR, you can remove it using the following steps:

### Steps:
1. **Identify the Commit to Remove:**
   ```bash
   git log
   ```
   - Note the commit ID before the unwanted commit.

2. **Reset to the Previous Commit:**
   ```bash
   git reset <previous_commit_ID>
   ```
   - This unstages changes made after the specified commit.

3. **Stash the Changes (Optional):**
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

4. **Force Push the Updated Snapshot:**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name> -f
   ```
   - The unwanted commit will be removed from the PR.

**Problem**:
You have created a new branch, made changes, staged and committed them, and pushed the branch to the remote repository using `git push origin gitcontent`. Now, you want to merge this branch into the `master` branch both locally and remotely.

---

**Solution**:

To merge your `gitcontent` branch into the `master` branch in both the local and remote repositories, follow these steps:

1. **Switch to the `master` branch locally**:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

2. **Update your local `master` branch by pulling the latest changes from the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

3. **Merge the `gitcontent` branch into `master`**:
   ```bash
   git merge gitcontent
   ```

4. **Resolve any merge conflicts**, if they arise. If there are conflicts, Git will mark the conflicting files, and you'll need to manually edit them to resolve the conflicts. After fixing the conflicts, stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   ```

5. **Commit the merge**:
   If there were any conflicts and you resolved them, or if it's a clean merge, commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Merge branch 'gitcontent' into master"
   ```

6. **Push the merged `master` branch to the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

---

After completing these steps, your `gitcontent` branch will be successfully merged into `master` both locally and remotely. If you no longer need the `gitcontent` branch, you can delete it:

- **Delete the local `gitcontent` branch**:
  ```bash
  git branch -d gitcontent
  ```

- **Delete the remote `gitcontent` branch** (optional, if no longer needed):
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete gitcontent
  ```

This will clean up both your local and remote repositories.

### **Problem:**

You have created a branch named `bug`, made changes, staged, and committed them. However, while you were working on `bug`, new commits were added to the `main` branch. Now, you want to rebase your `bug` branch onto the latest `main` branch and merge it both locally and remotely.

---

### **Solution:**

To rebase your `bug` branch onto the latest `main` branch and merge it into `main`, follow these steps:

---

1. **Switch to the `bug` branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout bug
   ```

2. **Rebase the `bug` branch onto the latest `main` branch:**

   - First, fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     ```

   - Then rebase the `bug` branch onto the latest `main` branch:

     ```bash
     git rebase origin/main
     ```

   - If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause and mark the conflicting files. Resolve the conflicts manually and stage the resolved files:

     ```bash
     git add <resolved-file>
     ```

   - Continue the rebase process after resolving conflicts:

     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

   - If you decide to abort the rebase process for any reason:

     ```bash
     git rebase --abort
     ```

3. **Switch to the `main` branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

4. **Pull the latest changes from the remote repository into `main`:**

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

5. **Merge the `bug` branch into `main`:**

   - Since the `bug` branch is now rebased onto `main`, the merge will be fast-forward:

     ```bash
     git merge bug
     ```

6. **Push the updated `main` branch to the remote repository:**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **Clean up the `bug` branch (if no longer needed):**

   - Delete the local `bug` branch:

     ```bash
     git branch -d bug
     ```

   - Optionally, delete the remote `bug` branch:

     ```bash
     git push origin --delete bug
     ```

---

### **Summary:**

Using the rebase method, you ensure that your `bug` branch integrates cleanly with the latest `main` branch, preserving a linear commit history. This approach is particularly useful in collaborative projects where a clean commit history is desired. Always communicate with your team before rebasing shared branches, as it rewrites commit history.
